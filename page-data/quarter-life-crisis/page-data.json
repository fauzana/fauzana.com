I can get things done at my \"own pace\". 😎✨ Just like any 'mature' tech-company, the main problem I've got to handle is \"complex legacy code/system\". You might change a thing, but you could break another thing. 😂 Ummm, another consequential thing as an implication of these legacy is any unintended behaviors (bugs) will be your sins because of your bad-luck for being assigned to the in-charge-team (even though you are not the one who code it). Hehehee.. 🤣</p>\n<p>Since I am assigned to the team who responsible for the one of company heart-beat, all my team-mates (Web/Apps Engineers, even our Data Scientist!) are well-prepared with amazing 😲 debugging skill. Oh, we also have a group named: allyourbugsarebelongtous. 🙊</p>\n<p>But don't worry, we are here to learn together. Just watch the steps/next moves so you are not gonna fall into the same hole in the future. Pssttt... My silly code ever delayed the deployment train! 😅</p>\n<p>As a Software Engineer for Front-End development, it's not hard for me to adapt the tech stack since my previous work is using the similar stuff. The only annoying part is coffeescript codebase! Hellow?! Anybody still write coffeescript code today? 👀</p>\n<h2 id=\"environment\"><a href=\"#environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Environment</h2>\n<p>Workspace is designed with open-space env with shared long workbench.
