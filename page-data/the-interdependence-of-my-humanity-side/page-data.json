Still in-love with javascript. Maybe this is the longest relationship I ever had outside family circle, huh.</p>\n<p>First met in one of laboratory as undergraduate student. I learned it as if the newborn powerful-at-that-time library named jQuery. After graduation, the second company I served was using Titanium Appcelerator, a multiplatform mobile development framework with javascript as its engine. A year later, as a Web Developer; no need more words to explain how strong our affection, <em>fufufufufuuu</em>. <code class=\"language-text\">|\\(-__- )&quot;</code></p>\n<p>If first half-last year I was buried <del>overwhelmed alone</del> both with someone <sub>I don't want to talk with for a lifetime</sub> caused by I don't think it's appropriate to be put here, now the team members in another (current) workplace and I running <strong>together</strong> with a tremendous flood behind us. I'll miss this team someday!</p>\n<p>A year before, the longest business trip I had was Jakarta - Bandung and met one of the famous pioneer iOS (mobile apps) development startup in Indonesia. Luckily, I was randomly chosen amongst employees in the company I serve to attend StartUpxJeju. Finally, I passed this colorful year and ended it with a long journey to Korea!</p>\n<h4 id=\"real-life-affair\"><a href=\"#real-life-affair\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Real Life Affair</h4>\n<p>Oh, well.. For these Five years, I only have 903 friends; Facebook friends though; not the real one, hehehee. And I suppose that one who resigned before should responsible of many things that we don't finished together. Hmmm... Nonetheless, I am the one who make it casual, no bonds, no commitment between us for the sake of my devotion.</p>\n<p>What's more, if the two are in deep affection, it doesn't mean both should be together at this time. Stick around for the right moment when all things are setting up. While counting the days, prepare themselves to be a better one. Time and distance will unlock its biggest secret, is that feeling growing up or fading away.</p>\n<h5 id=\"in-term-of-late-post\"><a href=\"#in-term-of-late-post\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>In term of Late Post</h5>\n<p>Due to my workload, I can't post on time.
