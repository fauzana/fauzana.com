What are the odds that I would wake up tomorrow and it will be my another birthday again? Yet another Happy Birthday or <em>Selamat Ulang Tahun</em>? Dipalakin buat makan-makan for annual celebration? In reality, it's not that <em>happy</em> at all <em>gengs</em>.

It was Umar ibn al-Khattab who nominated as a prominent companion of Muhammad. Who was he before? Did he a good person? How was he treat Muhammad in previous? In fact, he was so cruel man before~ Truthfully, he even ever planned to kill Muhammad. How barbaric isn't it? But at last, in the rest of his life, he known as the most influental Muslim caliphs.</p>\n<p>Ummm... Maybe I should write about my thought on what people wasted on faith arguments/debates next time. All belief in this world teach the same thing about tenderness, well, at least it just in my mind (^^ゞ`. Hahhaaha. It just human basic characters who are greedy and self-indulgent.</p>\n<p>It's ok for being inadequate before. What? are you a good/better/best one?
