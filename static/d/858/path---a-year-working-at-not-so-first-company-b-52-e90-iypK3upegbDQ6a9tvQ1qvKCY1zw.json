Two faces exactly. \"One Face\" had departed, so I wasn't catch a glimpse of that person appearance on that day. It was about three months we never <del>see each other</del> meet. Sounds wicked right? To be honest, for inclusively both of them I was praying for their better work-life-job-career, much, much better from present. It could be God rolled His dice in these different way for each of them.</p>\n<p>I remembered on the second of our small-talk, a person said, \"I am <del>lazy</del> listless to find another.\" In that time, my heart screamed, \"You shouldn't end up here! <del>You</del> We are not belong here! We deserve better!\" Listless (in Indonesian, means <em>malas</em> as well) is the most <em>sweet</em> word I ever heard for that occation. Since then, I added one list pray onto my stacks of desires for God to be answered <em>soon(?)</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"yet-another-story\"><a href=\"#yet-another-story\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Yet Another Story</h3>\n<p>A small bird was flying south to escape the cold. On the way, it got so cold that the bird froze mid-air and fell to the ground in a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawing him! He lay there all warm and happy; and immediately began to sing from joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung; and promptly dug him out and ate him!</p>\n<p>Moral of the story:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not everyone who drop shit on you is your enemy.</li>\n<li>Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.</li>\n<li>And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!</li>\n<li>\n<p>Never hate people for all eternity. They are here for some reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bad gives you experience.</li>\n<li>The good gives you happiness.</li>\n<li>The worst gives you lessons.</li>\n<li>The best gives you memories.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"leaving-the-company\"><a href=\"#leaving-the-company\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Leaving the Company?</h4>\n<p>Final thought on the same topic, it seems too old but worthy to be re-shared again.
