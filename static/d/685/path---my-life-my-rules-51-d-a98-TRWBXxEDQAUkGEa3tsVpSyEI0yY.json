The old cat saw the kitten chasing its tail and asked, \"Why are you chasing your tail?\"</p>\n<p>To it the kitten replied, \"I've been attending cat philosophy school and I've learned that the most important thing for a cat is happiness, and that happiness is located in my tail. Therefore, I am chasing it: and when I catch it, I shall have happiness forever.\"</p>\n<p>Laughing the wise old cat replied, \"My son, I wasn't lucky enough to go to cat philosophy school, but as I've gone through life. I too have realized that the most important thing for a cat is happiness, and indeed that it is located in my tail. The difference I've found though is that <strong>whenever I chase after it, it keeps running away</strong> from me, but when I <strong>go about my bussiness and live my life</strong>, it just seems to follow after me wherever I go.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-happiness-of-pursuit\"><a href=\"#the-happiness-of-pursuit\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Happiness of Pursuit</h2>\n<p>It has been 7 months (in exact) been working as programmer serabutan. Many crazy things happened; or for ethical reason, let say I'm the one who crazy (<em>The Freaky Nana</em>) hehehee.. <code class=\"language-text\">ψ(｀∇´)ψ</code> Just like another mainstream posts, these words are going about my 2014 in review. In the beginning of that year, I had to choose a complicated decision between academic or industry to continue my own life drama-script.

Although nobody can guarantee both choices could bring happiness, I can build my own fulfilment from this job hopefully.
