> Finally, Graduation! 🎓🎉

Today, my farewell from the first company that I served in Jakarta. Not the first one who accepted me though `∩(︶▽︶)∩`. Actually, my last-employment-day is on 1<sup>st</sup> of June. But I needed a break, because at the same date, I had a deal joining another start-up.

In very-late-afternoon, I was given a certificate of employment. But, not to mention that I'm greedy, the conduct/verdict/assessment-result/evaluation/appraisal/honour written there was __Good__. What kind of *good* that you want Nana? Hahaa. For me, being good is as the same as bad; I deserve better. You know what? My mantra is __Better isn't enough when the Best is Expected__. So, am I just __only__ a good one? Or just __looks__ good? Bad-Luck Nana cause throughout her whole life this-kind-of-thing must be above-standard, beyond-average if needed, hehee. Meanwhile my expectation is kinda with ~~high/highest~~ distinction. `ｏ( ><)o`

### The Face(s) that I want Disappear on the Same Day

On the day I called graduation day, there are face(s) I hope not to come across in front of me. Two faces exactly. "One Face" had departed, so I wasn't catch a glimpse of that person appearance on that day. It was about three months we never ~~see each other~~ meet. Sounds wicked right? To be honest, for inclusively both of them I was praying for their better work-life-job-career, much, much better from present. It could be God rolled His dice in these different way for each of them.

I remembered on the second of our small-talk, a person said, "I am ~~lazy~~ listless to find another." In that time, my heart screamed, "You shouldn't end up here! ~~You~~ We are not belong here! We deserve better!" Listless (in Indonesian, means _malas_ as well) is the most _sweet_ word I ever heard for that occation. Since then, I added one list pray onto my stacks of desires for God to be answered _soon(?)_.

### Yet Another Story

A small bird was flying south to escape the cold. On the way, it got so cold that the bird froze mid-air and fell to the ground in a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was actually thawing him! He lay there all warm and happy; and immediately began to sing from joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung; and promptly dug him out and ate him!

Moral of the story:

* Not everyone who drop shit on you is your enemy.
* Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.
* And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!
* Never hate people for all eternity. They are here for some reasons.
  * The bad gives you experience.
  * The good gives you happiness.
  * The worst gives you lessons.
  * The best gives you memories.

#### Leaving the Company?

Final thought on the same topic, it seems too old but worthy to be re-shared again. Let the pictures speak a thousands words.

##### What employer want?

##### Also, the Last Word

Other's trash is someone else's treasure.
Just like other's hell is someone else's heaven.
