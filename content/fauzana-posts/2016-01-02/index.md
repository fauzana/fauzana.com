### Resolution

This year resolution is still the same with a year past: __2560 x 1600__ at 227px; 13.3" retina display + IPS technology. Oh, wait? The distinction is the additional `force-touch trackpad`! Zzzz... Stop kidding _Nanaaaarrgghhh_, wkwkwkwkwkkk.

### Work and JavaScript Romance

Finally, I landed the job I really wanted to. Working on chaotic-fast-lane! There are ~~flood~~ <sub>blood</sub> everywhere. It seems funny looked at all people around in this company involved in daily topsy-turvy. Me? Still in-love with javascript. Maybe this is the longest relationship I ever had outside family circle, huh.

First met in one of laboratory as undergraduate student. I learned it as if the newborn powerful-at-that-time library named jQuery. After graduation, the second company I served was using Titanium Appcelerator, a multiplatform mobile development framework with javascript as its engine. A year later, as a Web Developer; no need more words to explain how strong our affection, _fufufufufuuu_. `|\(-__- )"`

If first half-last year I was buried ~~overwhelmed alone~~ both with someone <sub>I don't want to talk with for a lifetime</sub> caused by I don't think it's appropriate to be put here, now the team members in another (current) workplace and I running __together__ with a tremendous flood behind us. I'll miss this team someday!

A year before, the longest business trip I had was Jakarta - Bandung and met one of the famous pioneer iOS (mobile apps) development startup in Indonesia. Luckily, I was randomly chosen amongst employees in the company I serve to attend StartUpxJeju. Finally, I passed this colorful year and ended it with a long journey to Korea!

#### Real Life Affair

Oh, well.. For these Five years, I only have 903 friends; Facebook friends though; not the real one, hehehee. And I suppose that one who resigned before should responsible of many things that we don't finished together. Hmmm... Nonetheless, I am the one who make it casual, no bonds, no commitment between us for the sake of my devotion.

What's more, if the two are in deep affection, it doesn't mean both should be together at this time. Stick around for the right moment when all things are setting up. While counting the days, prepare themselves to be a better one. Time and distance will unlock its biggest secret, is that feeling growing up or fading away.

##### In term of Late Post

Due to my workload, I can't post on time. I gotta stood by to finish the code in order to be able secure my salary(?) on following month and after `#lebay` `#NonSense` `#berle`. I'm sort of person who have zero-tolerant for dilatory things. For everything I has been through, perhaps I need to look back. Just to find where I dropped my standards, lost my confidence and started settling for less than I deserve.
