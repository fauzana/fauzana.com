## The Pursuit of Happiness

There was an old wise cat and a small kitten in an alleyway. The old cat saw the kitten chasing its tail and asked, "Why are you chasing your tail?"

To it the kitten replied, "I've been attending cat philosophy school and I've learned that the most important thing for a cat is happiness, and that happiness is located in my tail. Therefore, I am chasing it: and when I catch it, I shall have happiness forever."

Laughing the wise old cat replied, "My son, I wasn't lucky enough to go to cat philosophy school, but as I've gone through life. I too have realized that the most important thing for a cat is happiness, and indeed that it is located in my tail. The difference I've found though is that __whenever I chase after it, it keeps running away__ from me, but when I __go about my bussiness and live my life__, it just seems to follow after me wherever I go."

## The Happiness of Pursuit

It has been 7 months (in exact) been working as programmer serabutan. Many crazy things happened; or for ethical reason, let say I'm the one who crazy (_The Freaky Nana_) hehehee.. `ψ(｀∇´)ψ` Just like another mainstream posts, these words are going about my 2014 in review. In the beginning of that year, I had to choose a complicated decision between academic or industry to continue my own life drama-script. Suddenly, I put my choice in industry and dropped all _silly_ preparation for academic plan (_postgraduate_ school).

### Reason?

_Is there anything need NO reason other than love?_ `(⌒_⌒;)`

Well, as the same as the young cat above, I'm searching for _happiness_; mastery on my own; an autonomy. Although nobody can guarantee both choices could bring happiness, I can build my own fulfilment from this job hopefully. Even so, I'm still young enough to do many absurd things, so I have many stupid things to laugh at my own old.

#### Rules of Life(?)

1. Make peace with your past, so it won't screw up the present.
2. What others think of you is none of your concern.
3. Time heals almost everything, give it time.
4. Don't compare your life to others and don't judge them. You have no idea what their journey is all about.
5. Stop thinking too much. It's alright not to know the answers. They will come to you when you least expect it.
6. No one is in charge of your happiness, except You.
7. Smile. You don't own all the problems in the world.

##### Ummm... My work(?)

Back to this troublesome topic, at the end of my 2014, I got a new skillset in __cursing__. A very, very new-born skill that I never had before. Now, I'm still looking for such other decent place to land a job ~~so I can work happily ever after~~. Thank you for reading my rant post. 👋🏼😜
