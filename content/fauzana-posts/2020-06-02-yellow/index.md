☎️ This is Nana speaking. Hang on there a sec.

Well, I deleted entire words I prepared for this morning. I think it wasn't appropiate to be put here. If you are still wondering about why I took down before it's posted, let's have an offline talk!

## A Year of Switching Career Track

> Management is not for everyone and Not everyone is management material.

Being on leadership position is not an easy road. Do you love meetings? Do you like to teach or coach? How are your feedback skills? Does conflict make you cringe? Will you answer NO? It's always people problem.

Becoming a first time manager requires a transformation of professional identity. Money? Power? Perks? Nope. It's all about interdependence. The outcome is dependent on others; direct reports, peers, and our own bosses. Get things done by working with and through others, rather than being the one doing the work.

## Another Term of Prelude
