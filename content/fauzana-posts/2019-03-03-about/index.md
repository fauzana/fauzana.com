Welcome, dear Reader; to my not-so-incridible and truthfully, powerfully hard-core online journals. So, it's your first stop here? Hmm, where have you been around? You've missed a lot of mind-boggling journey. But it's okay. I forgive you. We all have to begin somewhere, _I suppose_.

Allow me to introduce myself. I am Fauzana S, but please call me Nana. S? Ice? ❄️ Only that? Oh well, to make it short and to repeat redundant answer again, my last name is only a single character; beyond 26 characters combination choices but it was my parent authority. `full-stop`

During my adventurous occupation as a software engineer, such as scanning between painful tons of code or brainwashing a junky box that yearning for electricity and invisble connection to establish a mesh relationship in my spacious hopefully cubicle, but it was shared long workbench for a whole day, I like nothing more than finding myself pursuing meaning, trapped in unplanned expedition, or entangled in the new conundrum just to waste life-time. It really does get my heart beating and blood pumping day-by-day.

In conclusion, then, dear Reader: I am, quite simply, fantastic astonishing boring person. 👻

Thank you for stopping by to my blog. Wishing you a good smiling day :)

Enjoy the journals. Cheers. ✌🏽<br>
