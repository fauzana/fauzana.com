In honor of _titah_ netizen; who (87%) chose "Now & Future"-tale, here is the chronicle, Majesty. 👑

## Me vs JavaScript

I still put my bet on you. 😛 Some programming languages gain popularity. Meanwhile, others are getting sunset. Just don't leave me soon. We should have a good time for the next one decade. No, no, I am not look after, not look forward, not even look up on you. _#ezegedeh_ <small>Ngapain buang-buang waktu jagain <small>jodoh</small> orang _#eh_, LoL. Udah jadi punya orang jg masih berpotensi buat ditikung kok, LoL, ngakak kenceng. 🤣</small> Just enjoy while it lasts, cause we all know nothing last forever. 🌊

## Me vs Prime Number

> Bilangan prima apa yang habis dibagi 2?

Isn't it obvious that I am a Prime Number Enthusiast? 🤓 Prime (First Importance) can be transformed into Primary (Chief Importance). What's good about it? It refers to NOT being secondary or subordinate. If we take a look into Mathematics, Prime Number is a number that divisible only by itself and unity. The Number also has a great power to generate keys in Cryptography. Great, isn't it?

How does it feel to have a "Prime" life? A life of yours and the Only One?

And back into the previous question, <br>

## On My Mind

I think I know your dreams <br>
But I just know your plans.

I think I know your heart <br>
But I just know your ego.

I think I know your past <br>
But I just know your parts.

I just don't give my trust away easily. <br>
Earn it.

#### Why?

We don't grow a huge tree with beautiful fruits/flowers __overnight__ <br>
It takes time.

No matter how much you water it <br>
It takes time.

No matter how much sunlight you give it <br>
It takes time.

Just remember, you can't eat the fruits on the same day you plant the seed.

### Being On Purpose

Guess what? After all "those" happened, I end up questioning 'you', questioning 'your life', questioning 'your compassion'.

### On Being Simple

Missing somebody? `/call` <br>
Wanna meet up? `/invite` <br>
Wanna be understood? `/explain` <br>
Have question? `/ask` <br>
Don't like something? `/speak up` <br>
Like something? `/share it` <br>
Want something? `/ask` <br>

### Future Outlook

Still under construction. No one can guarantee our plan is gonna working out. It's 50:50. He never promise me anything, nor I am. But we **agreed** on having serious dialogue on it, <small>soon <small>unless one of us change mind </small>😅</small>. <small>No, we didn't date. Technically, he's a boy friend, not a boyfriend, **a space** is needed. But he's a someone, a maybe, or an almost.</small>

> Life has taught me that you can't control someone's loyalty. No matter how good you are to them, doesn't mean they'll treat you the same. No matter how much they mean to you, doesn't mean they'll value you the same. Sometimes the people you care the most, turn out to be the people you can trust the least. <br>
