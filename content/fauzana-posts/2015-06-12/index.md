> To whom it may concern,

Pretending to be good people in front of her<br>
Being gentle to her<br>
And no matter how many times she says "_Sorry_"<br>
You reply with "_No Problem_"

But when she's not here<br>
You say things like the opposite instead

Honestly<br>
It's very troubling

If you don't like it<br>
Then don't help her in the first place

"_It's troubling. It's difficult. It's tiring._"<br>
Say it to her face __directly__

Don't trap her by going around in circles

__*Be strong, go ahead, move forward!*__
