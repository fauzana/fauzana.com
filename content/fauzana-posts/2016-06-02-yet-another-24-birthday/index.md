It's time to re-evaluate my evolution in a year, every part of my life. In a few hours, I will be `{ yx^y | x is even Prime Number, y is first odd Prime Number }`.

Today is my first work anniversary at [Q-things Startup](https://qareergroup.asia/). But, I won't let this post go on working or office things. It's so pathetic in just few minutes ago I just went back to my room and left unfinished work `ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ`. I vividly remember what happened a year ago on the same date. It was my first-[Qerja](https://www.qerja.com/)-day and my workplace was an aquarium (again) with `A`, `B`, and `S` as my first co-workers `Ｏ(≧∇≦)Ｏ`. Hahahah, I think I should stop here or its gonna be a gossip, wkwkkwkk.

Well, for that first thing matter, what does mean turning 20, 31, and even 42, _gengs_? What are the odds that I would wake up tomorrow and it will be my another birthday again? Yet another Happy Birthday or _Selamat Ulang Tahun_? Dipalakin buat makan-makan for annual celebration? In reality, it's not that _happy_ at all _gengs_. The truth is ~~Selamat~~ Ilang Tahun, we are getting older, life-span is going down, so tell me which part you say _happy_?

## On Wrong Priority

It was my mistake for settling a wrong person in my highest priority list. Two months ago, I tried to stick up what we've been through. Unexpectedly, his true face soul revealed, ouch! It does not take much time to cross out the name and cut out everything about.

I expected four alphabet characters to ask me about; __r u o k__ at that time; instead of clarify the same things again and again for ever being the most annoying person on this planet I ever met. <sub>And of course, another list come up.</sub>

You know what? I am still can't figure out from unlimited counter/reaction of my words, he responded in that way. _Bye! Bhay! Baymax! Bhay to the Max!_

### On No Progress

Progress (noun) | forward or onward movement towards a destination.

Either it's significant of not, based on its meaning, progress has two major components: movement and destination. What kind of movement we stepped into? Are we heading to the same destination? For every single day we passed, do we really move?

### On Being Narcist
Don't be a j<sup>*</sup>rk! Your mom should have teach you saying thank you if someone has been helpful. Ah, let me correct myself. I should be grateful `／(x~x)＼`. It was just me, the narcissistic person on the earth. You, yes You; are so damn right. As I stated before, it was my mistake. OK, _fyne_, I am wrong.

### A Short Narrative

This is about one of stories in Islamic history. It was Umar ibn al-Khattab who nominated as a prominent companion of Muhammad. Who was he before? Did he a good person? How was he treat Muhammad in previous? In fact, he was so cruel man before~ Truthfully, he even ever planned to kill Muhammad. How barbaric isn't it? But at last, in the rest of his life, he known as the most influental Muslim caliphs.

Ummm... Maybe I should write about my thought on what people wasted on faith arguments/debates next time. All belief in this world teach the same thing about tenderness, well, at least it just in my mind (^^ゞ`. Hahhaaha. It just human basic characters who are greedy and self-indulgent.

It's ok for being inadequate before. What? are you a good/better/best one? Geez.. `:D` The cold hard truth is the misdeeds are covered by the kindness, ingat 'aib gengs, 'aib!

> Forgiving is not forgetting; its actually remembering -- remembering and not using your right to hit back. Its a second chance for a new beginning. And the remembering part is particularly important. Especially if you dont want to repeat what happened.<br>
