It was the time to make a reflection, defining life-meaning. What kind of life I've been through in this 22 years. Life is short, huh?

Tonight, just like annual-ritual, and to make it short, this post is about my evaluation before turning into another `age += 1;`. Kind of the things I regret exactly. So, here are the lists!

### 1. Brave

Take a chance, make a change. Second chance never comes. Take a risk.

### 2. If I had only...

Do not mention your past again and again. No repeating `drama-queen-story`. Brace yourself. You are the one who decided.

### 3. I will

Once you say, "_I will_", your perspective changes. What previously seemed insurmountable is no longer a matter of luck or chance but of time and effort and persistence. When what you want to do really matters, don't say "I'll try." Say, "_I will_" and then do everything possible to keep that promise to yourself.

### 4. Give Shots

You may never create the perfect things, may never find the perfect partners or the perfect job-market or the perfect location, but you can find the perfect time to start -- because that time is now. Ultimately, success is a numbers game; it's all about taking a shot, over and over and over again. The more shots you take, the more times you will succeed. So get the power of numbers on your side and take as many shots as you can. There is no guarantee of success, but when you don't take any shots at all, you're guaranteed to always fail.

### 5. Move

Familiarity creates comfort. But comfort is often the enemy of improvement.

### 6. Let Go

Bitterness, resentment, and jealousy are like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. You are the only one who loses. Life is too short to resent all the people who may have hurt you. __Let hard feelings go__. Then spend the energy you save cherishing the people you love and who love you.

### 7. Sorry

We all make mistakes, so we all have things we need to apologize for: words, actions, omissions, failing to step up, step in, to be there when we're needed... Swallow your fear -- _or pride_ -- and say you're sorry. Then you'll help the other person let go of their resentment or bitterness. And then you both get to make the freshest of fresh starts, sooner instead of later -- or instead of never.

### 8. Backup Plan

Don't have any? Make it so when something doesn't work out you can do a soft landing. Just in some case, the company does not love you. It has no heart. It just a name. You are replaceable. Keep your parachute handy.

### 9. Not too proud

Don't be too proud to admit you made a mistake. Don’t be too proud to have big dreams, or to poke fun at yourself, or to ask other people for help. Don’t be afraid to take a chance and fall on your face… and then to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and go again. Instead, take pride in the fact that no matter what might happen, you will always get up and go again. That way, you never truly lose -- and your dreams can never, ever die.

### 10. Care

Rejection hurts. Sadness hurts. Failure hurts; sometimes a lot. So what do you do? Avoid getting hurt by deciding you no longer care. But then you never get to experience the joy of connection, the joy of happiness, and the joy of success.

> Choose to still be in the game.<br>
> Choose to care.<br>
> Choose to live.

Last but not the least, there is no such regret. _Just a lesson_. Now it's your turn. What things do you hope to never to regret?
