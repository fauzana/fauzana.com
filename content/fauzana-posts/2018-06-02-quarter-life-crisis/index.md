Uwuwuwuuu~ It's about 6 months I've been worked for one of largest Indonesian digital market-place! Those months were so meaningful; surrounded by different people, culture, workflow, point of view, and of course the tech stack. In this post, not like "that" annual post, I will reveal the things that impressed me during my-first-lapak-day, as a reflection for my age += 1. 😝

## Workload and Responsibility

Honestly, the workload and pressure are lower than *all* my previous employers. I can get things done at my "own pace". 😎✨ Just like any 'mature' tech-company, the main problem I've got to handle is "complex legacy code/system". You might change a thing, but you could break another thing. 😂 Ummm, another consequential thing as an implication of these legacy is any unintended behaviors (bugs) will be your sins because of your bad-luck for being assigned to the in-charge-team (even though you are not the one who code it). Hehehee.. 🤣

Since I am assigned to the team who responsible for the one of company heart-beat, all my team-mates (Web/Apps Engineers, even our Data Scientist!) are well-prepared with amazing 😲 debugging skill. Oh, we also have a group named: allyourbugsarebelongtous. 🙊

But don't worry, we are here to learn together. Just watch the steps/next moves so you are not gonna fall into the same hole in the future. Pssttt... My silly code ever delayed the deployment train! 😅

As a Software Engineer for Front-End development, it's not hard for me to adapt the tech stack since my previous work is using the similar stuff. The only annoying part is coffeescript codebase! Hellow?! Anybody still write coffeescript code today? 👀

## Environment

Workspace is designed with open-space env with shared long workbench. Since my squad named: Shopping Growth, it's reflected to our team members growth too! It hits 20-ish! 🙈 Now, I should sit between two table and put my leg between the table-leg. Sigh. #curcol

Since I've been dealing with numerous people and their background since my teenager, blending with new coworkers (again) and to adapt new culture (again) isn't really a big deal. The first thing to introduce myself is my own identity (e.g: kampung, stereotype, etc). It was the best thing I had, to start a new conversation with others.

## Culture

As a Data-Driven company, let the number/fact speak! 😎 Overtime? Feature request? etc. Whole decisions are data-based. Non-sense shall no pass! 🙈

### Perks

Outside attractive compensations and benefits? Lunch/Dinner/Limited Breakfast provided. Unlimited Coffee/Tea? Find it in Pantry. Flexible office hours. Need a literature? Just wait for "pengadaan buku". Online course? Commercial license? You may request. Fun room and Gym; that I never stepped into. Insightful professional talks and a stage for you to excercise with real audiences. Guild for your favorite stuff/hobby. dll.dsb.dst. Huuft.

#### On Something called "Mencari Jati Diri"

As ever been Software Engineer for mobile apps and web, I am still searching for an identity to fulfill my curiousity. Rapid-changing-tech-update, hajar! 👊🏽 Human-engineering, hajar! 👊🏽 Written-art, hajar! 👊🏽

### Bukalapak::Qerja

This is the hardest thing to explain, but lets bygone be bygone. I think I couldn't explain this well for my entire life because there are so many unexplained and everything left was mystery-hole. Just leave it as it is, ok?

#### The Forgotten Message

After a lot of drama-series, I opened my LinkedIn message, scrolled it down to the lowermost and found an InMessage:

![An Offer from Bukalapak](/images/post-images/Screen-Shot-2018-06-01-at-19.10.32.png "An Offer from Bukalapak")

It has been 6 years ago, I was a last-year student in USU, Medan. Been contacted, such a honor. 😌

### On Quarter-Life Crisis

Well, for being living this far, it's time to "start" giving a thought about what all society complained about: "real lyfe partner be lyke". Since I'm kind of "that's none of your business"-person, all mumbles around just go away and pass into silence. 🤣 I never take them seriously. If someone wanna stay, just stay. If someone wanna leave, just leave. If it should be a "serious", state it explicitly and I'll show how far the path I've been walked through and where my final destination is, so you are the one who decide whether to join a wander together. It's dead simple.

#### Never Assume

Just ask. If you doubt it, don't do it. Re-ask untill you reach the confindence bar. Any question, should have their answer. Like a lock is created with their own key. 😉 Occasionally, we might not find the answer instantly. It can take some times to find out the truth we seek. To wait or not, you decide!
